How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlights all changes rather than require you to scan everything

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Tracks changes which would lead to mistakes/changes where it isn't obvious where they came from

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You end up with way too many versions with the google system, but people forget, otherwise, so likely you'll lose information

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git Log shows all the versions, git diff shows you the changes between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You have a backup and a full log of changes, it will be easy t ofind and revert back to previous versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
